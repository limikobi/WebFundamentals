Gran Turismo 5 is a racing game that was released in 2010 for the PlayStation 3. It features over 1000 cars and 26 tracks, as well as various modes and features. However, some of the content in the game was only available as downloadable content (DLC) that had to be purchased separately or obtained through special promotions. Unfortunately, the DLC was removed from the PlayStation Store in 2014, making it impossible for new players or those who lost their data to access it.

Fortunately, there is a way to get all the DLC in Gran Turismo 5 without having to pay or connect to the PlayStation Network. All you need is a PS3, a USB flash drive, a copy of Gran Turismo 5 (version 2.11 or above), and a program called GT5 Save Editor. This program allows you to edit your save game and add any car, track, paint, or gear that you want. You can even get some rare cars that were only available in certain regions or events, such as the Chrome Line Jaguar XJ13 or the Edge Camaro.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use the GT5 Save Editor to get all the DLC in Gran Turismo 5. This method is fast, easy, and safe, as long as you follow the instructions carefully and back up your save game before editing it. You will also be able to play offline with your DLC cars and tracks without any issues. However, we do not recommend using this program to cheat online or create hybrids, as that would ruin the fun and fairness of the game for others.
 
## Step 1: Copy Your Save Game to a USB Flash Drive
 
The first thing you need to do is copy your save game from your PS3 to a USB flash drive. There are two save games in Gran Turismo 5: one is the regular save, and the other is the backup. You only need the regular one, which you can find under Game > Save Data Utility on your PS3 menu. Select your save game and press Triangle, then choose Copy and select your USB flash drive as the destination. Wait until the copying process is done, then eject your USB flash drive from your PS3.
 
## Step 2: Open Your Save Game with GT5 Save Editor
 
The next thing you need to do is download GT5 Save Editor from [this thread](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/the-gt5-garage-editor-thread.379802/) on GTPlanet[^2^]. This program is compatible with Windows and Mac OS X, and it does not contain any viruses or malware. However, you may get a warning message from your antivirus software or Windows Defender when you run it. Just click More Info and Run Anyway to proceed.
 
Once you have downloaded and extracted GT5 Save Editor, open it and click File > Open. Navigate to your USB flash drive and find your save game folder. It should be named PS3 > SAVEDATA > BCUS98114-GAME (or something similar depending on your region). Inside that folder, there should be a file called GT5.GAMEDATA.SAVE. This is the file you need to open with GT5 Save Editor.
